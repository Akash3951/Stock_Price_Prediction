# 📈Stock_Price_Prediction
This project leverages historical stock market data to predict future stock prices using data analysis and visualization tools. Built using Python and deployed with Streamlit, it provides an interactive dashboard where users can explore trends and patterns in stock prices of publicly traded companies.

# 🔍 Features
Fetch real-time and historical stock data using Yahoo Finance.
Perform data cleaning and preprocessing with Pandas and NumPy.
Visualize stock price trends with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Build and evaluate prediction models.
Interactive web app built using Streamlit.
Save and load models using Pickle.
